    "summary": "  Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding\nchallenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art\ngenerative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in\n3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited\nability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce\nrealistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we\nintroduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement\nlearning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.\nBuilt upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score\nfunction to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our\nNabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D\nreward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning\nbaselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,\nNabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting\nwithin a few finetuning steps.\n",

    "summary": "  With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal\nproblems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more\nsevere, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.\nAlthough existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed\nby text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily\npossess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,\nresulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.\nTo address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector\nspecialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its\nfamily-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the\nbase models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual\ncharacteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families\nshow its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores\nof over 96%.\n",
